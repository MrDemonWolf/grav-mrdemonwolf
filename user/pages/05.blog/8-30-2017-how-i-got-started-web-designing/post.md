Have you ever wondered what it is like to be a web designer? Let me take you along and share my perspective on being a web designer. My passion for web design was sparked in the early months of 2012, when I left a community forum. It was at this moment that I wanted to make a change and disrupt communities by delivering a high quality forum based platform.

It was at this moment that I had to teach myself how to design an interactive and visually appealing forum but more importantly provide a user friendly experience. Once I had set out a basic strategy I started doing research by looking at the look and feel that my target audience was attracted to right now. By creating a case study I was able to design and develop my personal forum where users could easily find the information they needed whilst maintaining a clean, attractive design.

All of this took hard work and effort, and it wasn’t until I had re-done the website a multitude of times that I decided to take on WordPress. After using the platform for a short period of time I decided it offered exactly what I had been looking for and learnt how to build full web applications instead of just a simple blogging engine.

As time progressed it was time for a rename to elevate the platform to the next level. It was my time to go back to the drawing board. Leveraging the lessons I had learnt over the past few years of running the forum and website, I was able to establish a way to attract more visitors. 2017 has been a very promising year this far and we are certainly very proud of how far we’ve come. By establishing and maintaining a professional look and feel we reflect the way we work — professional, clean, responsible and visually appealing. One of the biggest lessons I took from all the designs I have done up until now is to never give up. You may have to redo your design a lot of times, but it is worth it to stick through.
