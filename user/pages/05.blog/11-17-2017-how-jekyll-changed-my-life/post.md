How has Jekyll changed my life? I want to take the time to summarize my experiences with WordPress prior to Jekyll to compare how effective Jekyll has been over the past year.
Even though I stopped using WordPress, there is a good use for WordPress and I can respect that.
I used WordPress for many years as my go-to CMS and created a variety of websites with WordPress including portfolios, personal websites, blogs.
Jekyll came to my attention after I heard about its ease of use and the lightweight option it offered if you want to use GitHub pages for hosting.

Jekyll has been a great experience to me and it served me well for my personal website — <a href="https://www.mrdemonwolf.me">mrdemonwolf.me</a> — but I hope to see a stronger set of Documentation coming to it soon, especially when it comes to Liquid templating and the (hidden) powers it offers.
These tricks, thought by one of the senior engineers at KreyNation — have given me the power to dynamically create the portfolio items I wanted to add during build for my personal website.
What I do want to emphasize is that these functions for dynamically creating content have really given me a good insight on slightly more advanced templating.

For now, I am exploring the options to build more Jekyll projects, such as a blog, as I will continue to work on projects at increasing sizes.
Either way it’s a very powerful tool to create static (GitHub Pages) websites fairly easily and allowing easy changes such as adding new blog items.

Overall my experience with Jekyll is very positive and it makes creating a website very easy.

Of course, one loses a lot of dynamic features, but the point that I don’t have to worry about any security issue ever, justifies this decision.

Also, load times are much fast, especially on a shared server. Have you tried building a GitHub pages website with Jekyll? Let me know about your experiences down below!
