So, you started a business and are using a Gmail, AOL, and or yahoo.   It’s your business so you should be branding it as your email.   There is a few great options for new starting businesses which give’s you a email like this ceo@yourcompany.com and not ceo.yourcompany@gmail.com.   Does it look much more professional when your domain is on it.  It could even increase the replies.

One of the best free ones is zoho.com they would give you a free business email with access via the web GUI for up to 25 users, with that you even get access to apps to use for your business the office suite may not be the best but its useable.  The two paid options are G Suite and Office 365.   Both with pros and cons.  One pro with G Suite is if you already have a domain with google its very easy to set up.  And it even allows you to use what you already have used at least once which is a Google Account.  One big downside to it is the office suite with it is not as powerful as others and does not have desktop apps.  On the other side office 365 has it all.  A great office suite and or email hosting with 50 GB of space.  You can get either or depending on what your business needs.

Using Office 365 business premium for the few months I have has really help me improve my business. Was able to fully use office with autosave and outlook email with it’s powerful calendar with skype business integration and more.  One downside it may be hard to setup at first but once you get use to the setup process it’s not to hard.  There is a lot of docs and or how to tips and tricks.  Well worth the money if you love using Microsoft Office and want custom domain email to go with it.  Best of all you get 1TB per user of OneDrive to store all your company files and share within the company.

As you know starting a business is hard and costly but does not always have to be.  With the right tools you can work your way up to the pros.  If your light on cash Zoho is a great option for you.  Have a little more money you can spend and or need power office suite for your staff then G Suite or Office 365 with its Microsoft Office included.  All are great and should be able to suit anyways needs for there business.
