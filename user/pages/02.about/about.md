          'Journey started with wanting to build my own community with a group of friends.  As this was new to me had to start with researching around other communities seeing areas that could be improved.  Web design had to start with base layout with tweaking it around and learning new ways to make the dream come true.  After many revisions fail, and restarts am a grad of what it has become. With all the hard work as able to make connections and help others make them as well.   Hope to see the community grow together.'

          'This is when the freelancing grind started.   Built a few free websites for my friends to challenge my self with clients.  One big person learned from this is clients can also be difficult to work with but as long you can push through it and help them grow their website its worth it, in the end, to see them smile.'
